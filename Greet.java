//task 101 start

hello testing git stash command usage
git stash will be used when a developer forced to stop the present work and advised to work on
other task which is having priority.  In that situation, instead of undo the present work we can
save that work in temporary storage/location/memory.  once the priority work is completed and 
pushed to git repository, we can recall/restore the code/work which was stopped in middle.
for that we can use git stash apply command.

//task 101 end

>>>>>>> Stashed changes
